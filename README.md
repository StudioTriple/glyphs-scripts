# Glyphs scripts

An assortment of scripts for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). 

## Script list

- **Add Extremes to Selection:** Adds extreme points to selected paths.
- **Add Tangent Nodes at a Specific Angle:** Insert points on the tangents at a specific angle. Optionally extrude the path in the same direction, creating a block shadow effect.
- **Copy Master into Sublayer:** Copies a master into a sublayer of another master for the selected glyphs. Useful for creating COLR/CPAL color fonts. Based on @mekkablue's Copy Layer to Layer script.
- **Interpolate Path with Itself:** Interpolates the path with itself. The fixed half will be the one with the start point. 
- **Make Next Node First:** Moves the start point of the selected  path(s) to the next oncurve node. Specially useful if assigned to a keyboard shortcut.
- **Make Previous Node First:** Moves the start point of the selected  path(s) to the previous oncurve node. Specially useful if assigned to a keyboard shortcut.
- **Open All Nodes:** Opens all nodes for the selected paths (or all paths if none are selected).
- **Open Selected Nodes:** Opens the selected nodes.
